    "To simplify the equations, we work in a principal-axis frame. That is, we choose a coordinate system that is co-moving with the rigid body and whose axes ($x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}$) are aligned with the principal axes of the body. With this assumption the inertia tensor is diagonalized and as a result $L_{i} = I_{i}\\omega_{i}$ with $i=1,2,3$. Here the $I_{i}$'s are the principal moments of inertia, i.e., the diagonal elements of the inertia tensor in the principal-axis frame. Because the body is rigid, the components of the inertia tensor are constant, so $\\dot{L}_{i}=\\frac{d}{dt}(I_{i}\\omega_{i})=I_{i}\\dot{\\omega}_{i}$. This yields Euler's equations of motion for a general rigid body\n",
